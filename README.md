# Movie Recommendation Amazon Alexa Skill
This was produced as part of a Hackathon over 2 days so the chance of technical mistakes are high.

This is the backend and interaction model JSON file for a basic Amazon Alexa Skill that allows users to ask Alexa for a reccomended movie choice based on the top 250 movies from IMDB. Users can get a random reccomendation or narrow it down through choices.

# C# Amazon Lambda Back-End

The backend of this skill is built using C# that is to be hosted on the Amazon Lambda service. The list of movies that can be reccomended are currently hardcoded due to limited time for production. The technical mistakes within the code are also prevelent throughout, once again due to limited production time for the hackathon

******

# Future
- Revise backend and refine
- Add API for external movie gathering
- Add futher interactions in the interaction model
